# rust-8
A CHIP-8 emulator / interpreter written in Rust.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/sullivant/rust-8.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/sullivant/rust-8)


This is largely a project there to let me tinker with more Rust with a "goal" in mind, even if I can move the goalposts anytime I'd like.  

That said, a lot of this is stuff I snagged from various example sites out there, so I'd like to remember them:

- Starrhorne: https://github.com/starrhorne/chip8-rust
- r/emudev: http://reddit.com/r/emudev
- Chip-8 and WebASM: https://blog.scottlogic.com/2017/12/13/chip8-emulator-webassembly-rust.html (though there is no webasm here..)
